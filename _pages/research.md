## Interference-Constrained Scheduling of a Cognitive Multihop Underwater Acoustic Network
In this project, optimal scheduling for a cognitive multihop underwater acoustic network with a primary user interference constraint is investigated. The network consists of primary and secondary users, with multihop transmission adopted for both of them. Key characteristics of underwater acoustic channels including large propagation delay, distanceand-frequency dependent attenuation, half-duplex modem constraint and inter-hop interference are taken into account in the design and analysis. The network scheduling goal is to maximize the end-to-end throughput of the whole system, while limiting the throughput loss of primary users. The framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process is applied to formulate the optimization problem and an optimal dynamic programming algorithm is derived. However, for this problem, the optimal dynamic programming solution is computationally intractable. Key properties are shown for the objective function, enabling the design of an approximate scheme which offers near optimal performance with significant complexity reduction. Numerical results show the proposed scheme significantly increases system throughput and while maintaining the primary throughput loss constraint.
